# Args Directory

Runtime behavior settings in YAML format.

- `preferences.yaml` — Timezone, model routing, content defaults, communication style.

Add more args files for specific workflows (e.g., `research.yaml` for research depth settings, `content.yaml` for platform-specific rules).

Skills read these files before executing to adapt their behavior.
